/**
 *  Let a class be used to represent goals of a BDI agent.
 *  Can be annotated to inner classes of an agent or in a {@link Goals}
 *  annotation to refer to external classes.
 *  
 *  Settings of this annotation give detailed control over the means-end reasoning
 *  and goal deliberation processes (see {@link Deliberation}) with regard to the annotated goal.
 *  
 *  The means-end reasoning is the process of plan selection and execution and is based
 *  on the notion of an "applicable plans list" (APL). When the goal needs processing,
 *  the agent determines the applicable plans and stores them in the APL.
 *  By default the plans are tried sequentially in the given order.
 *  Several goal flags like {@link #randomselection() randomselection} and {@link #posttoall() posttoall} allow changing this behavior.
