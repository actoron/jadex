*JCC Overview*

The Jadex Control Center (JCC) is the heart of most Swing based runtime tools. The JCC itself uses an extensible plugin-based mechanism to offer differnt functionalties to the user. As can be seen in the screenshot above it consists of different areas that are explained in the following:

**Menu:** In the menu general settings as well as plugin-specific ones can be found, i.e. the menu may change when the plugin view is changed. The general menu has a 'File' and a 'Help' section. In the first the platform and user interface settings can be saved or restored. Furthermore, in the help section a link to the Jadex online documentation can be found.

**Toolbar:** Similar to the menu also the toolbar consists of a plugin-specific (left-hand side) and a general part (right-hand side). The general part consists of icons for all currently loaded pluging. By clicking on another icon the corresponsing plugin will be activated and show in the lower area. By right clicking on a free space in the toolbar a popup menu can be activated that allows for adding new plugins at runtime. A plugin chooser allows for selecting the plugin to load. After successful initialization a new icon will be shown for the plugin at the right hand side of the toolbar. In addition to adding new pluging, also existing ones can be hidden or their ordering in the toolbar can be changed. For this purpose rightclick on a plugin icon. A popup menu will appear that allows you to move the icon to the left or right or hide it completely. Hidden plugins can be made visible again just by right clicking on a free space in the toolbar and selecting the hidden tool in the popup menu.

**Plugin**: The main plugin view in the middle of the JCC show the user interface of the currently selected plugin. 

**Console**: The console can be used to display the Java System.out and System.err streams of the platform. Especially, when adminstrating remote platforms it can be used to make visible the print outs of the otherwise inaccessible streams.

**Status line**: The status line is used by the plugins and the JCC itself to announce recent events to the user. The messages will be displayed for several seconds and vanish automatically. In additiona, on the right hand side of the status line current  processing activities may be visualized.
