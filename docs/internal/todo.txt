-------- Jadex Rules --------

- include only rules api in maven-generated apidocs


---- clean up this old mess ;-) ----
















Release 0.97
- simulation:
	- problem long is unsufficiently exact (-> introduce time object?)
	- solve problem of clock->executor loop (if a timed object does not lead
		to executor execution the loop breaks down)
	- do we want waitForTicks(int num)?
	- allow arbitrary many simulations running in their specific execution context
	- allow resetting an experiment an rerunning it from start
	- allow running simulations in batch mode
	- allow specifying experiment setups
	- filter time point view?
	- sometimes very slow execution when pressing run/step button?
		
- kernel
***	- fix BrowserPane memory leak caused by Java bug #6406218 (use new document, but what about stylesheet?)
*	- fix BrowserPane memory leak due to history (use history limit?, clear history method?, activate/deactivate history?)
	- model checking
		- check reference parameter names and types (used in triggers)
		- check assignment of abstract elements in inner capabilities
		- also check assignment of abstract parameters for abstract elements
		- check parameter mappings (type/direction compatibility, defined for all triggers)
	- update abstract capabilities to resemble current implementations
??	- only propagate after real change -> hook?
	- waitForConversationMessage(conv_id/msg?) only viable for fipa!?
???	- Use 1.5 Thread pool when running under Java 1.5+
	- microplansteps should be executed as direct consequences, not as extra steps, to avoid 
		interleaving with other (macro-)plansteps
	- cleanupplansteps should be executed before other (micro?)plansteps
		interleaving with other plansteps
	- maintain goal without recur can finish -> enabling maintain subgoals 
	- "subgoals" for external access, to be dropped when external access is disposed.
	- create metagoals also when one or no plan matches!? Allowing e.g. a planner to create one.
	- introduce semantic recur trigger for maintain goal
	- remote ams capability (use goals instead of belief set)
	- suppress event not handled warning, when event is handled by external access
	- allow inverse specification of inhibition arcs (e.g. inhibitedby instead of inhibits) for better extensibility.
	- allow finetuning of log-levels for BDI exceptions (for all exception types by classname?)
	- support new goalfinished elements as expression parameters ($goalfinished) for plan parameters (->MExpression.getSystemExpressionParameters()).
	- test all cases for meta level reasoning (message, goalinfo)
	- do not check some (e.g. system) XMLs (customizable for user XMLs, too)
?	- need option to make agent listeners transient (when used for gui, should not be migrated)
?	- replace rplanbase.createFilter() with waitabstraction (use waitabstraction instead of filter wherever possible)
?	- binding options for config (initial/end elements)
?	- arguments specific to configurations (defined on config elements?)
?	- MCapability.getParser() shouldn't be aware of janino-specific caching
?	- janino parser uses object cache limited to 25 entries (LRU)!?
?	- automatically remove listeners for removed elements (e.g. goal listeners)
	- testcap.tests_finished goal info event posted into end state!?
		(warning event not handled is logged although plan does dispatchgoalandwait)
		not a bug, but desired behaviour?
	- useful error messages when mixing plan/external elements
	- useful error message when dispatching a goal twice
	- test adding (and not removing) listeners in leaker
*	- remove target condition from query goal model (use runtime condition, only)
?	- remove metalevelreasoning flag (superseded by meta goals?)
?	- remove MReferenceParameter from jibx and binding
	- extend ping capability to support watchdog like pinging (maintain? goal for agent to ping, plan to execute when target agent no longer available?)
		- use ping functionality for webbridge and watchdog.capability
*	- warning when replying to a message without reply-with/convid parameters.
	- fix DynamicURLClassLoader.extractPackage() (see todo comment in source)
- tools
	- all
		- support also key command for popup (e.g. windows context menu key)
		- move tool reply code to tool adapters to cleanup outstanding messages, when tool deregisters.
	- jcc
*		- list of recent projects in file menu
	- starter
		- display jar nodes as broken
		- better error report in starter (better parse exception messages)

		- enable/disable details in testcenter (add show/hide button(s) and auto-enable-on-error checkbox)
		- manual-update, auto-update-on-failure options for details?
		- visualize results of executed testcases in tree
	-jadexdoc
		- Support linkage of Jadexdoc documentation
		- add -source option combo box for javadoc?

	- help
		- help for agent identifier
	- toolguide

	- provide useful runtime-error-messages when checking is disabled (e.g. MCapabilityReference.getCapability())
- examples
	- in multi-agent examples, kill agents using end goal in environment
	- cleanerworld
		- killing environment from starter leads to cleaner rp-protocol waiting for timeout, because of message not delivered
			- when trying to kill cleaner, rp gets aborted leading to waiting in cancel meta protocol, because of message not delivered
- misc
	- webbridge release
	- mobile release
		- split up jar
		- readme.txt
		- build.xml
	- remove distconf.properties from release dir
?	- ready to run bundles
	- add expression testcase for both parsers (how?)
	- print out version using splash screen
	- test cases for transports


Bugs:
*	- make suspend/resumeAgent goals delay until agent is really in the new state
*	- fix waitqueue behaviour for factadded etc (problem event is for specific condition)
*	- implement feature requests (from sourceforge)
	- DF keep registered bug, when leasetime==1000
	- Remove asserts if they prevent model from being loaded
		- should it be allowed to add report entry before checking
			is turned on?! e.g. in MExpression.setExpressionText
	- agent deletion does not wait until the other agent is deleted
		(when using dispatchSubgoalAndWait() it should return when the agent has died)
    - SUtil.toSLString/fromSLString methods are not able to cope
        with separators within names, e.g. comment in AbstractAgendaAction +")"
        also bdi viewer throws exception (tutorial lesson with beliefs)
	- process goals have wrong original goal when created for goal references
	    (causes problems with plan parameter mappings)
	- tool registration inits agent. calls getState() which calls getValue() etc.
	- repair doCheck() so that is does not init the agent (e.g. setting the assign from element of belief references),
		restructure getReport() so that does not has side effects, make doClone() more robust by not cloning rubbish
		such as assign from elements
		- getClazz() of some model elements still has side effects.
	- if both beliefchange and condition and ? trigger for a plan more than one plan instance is created
		as reaction on some event
	- check if default values of parameters of received messages are ignored.
	- remove stack traces from exception messages (use causes instead)
	- cache bug: a capabiliy has errors and is used in an agent -> agent shows error in capa
		fixing the bug in capa is recognized only in the capa. also reload on agent does not work in this case
		(this case is fixed, but some problem seems to remain :-(
	- AgentSelectorDialog: double click only works on left side of treetable
	- inconsistency between IWaitqueue.addSubgoal()/IWaitque.removeGoal(), also supports top-level goals?
?	- save platform settings as part of project
?	- per default start with example project
	- unify strong export and belief(set) initialization
	- JCC(s) and started agents should have separate class-loaders dependent on project
	- janino parser cannot handle broken string (e.g. '"') -> out of memory error.
	- ADFs cannot be loaded using the command-line when path contains special characters (like ö,ä,ß)
	
	
production version wish list:
-features
	- persistence of agents (automatic suspension, reloading on message arrival)
*	- message type email, ICQ, SMS, etc
*	- web-service integration
		- publish agent features (goals?) as web-services
		- call other web-services (can be done in java?)
-performance related:
	- fast condition evaluation
	- robustness (agents/platform)
*	- reduce agent size!
		- implement transparent caching for models (new copy on write approach)
		- implement a one-class read-only model
-tool related:
	- IDE support for ADFs (cross-references to classes, checking of models, jadexdoc-display)
	- better unit test for agents/plans


Post Release 1.0 wish list:
?	- should we try to encourage single line codings in style of
		Object result = createGoal("a").dispatchSubgoalAndWait().getParameter("r").getValue()
		alternatives:
		- dispatchSubgoalAndWait("a", varargs)
		- dispatchSubgoalAndWait(new Clean(..))

Release 1.0 wish list:
*- provide a better language level access for agents
*- introduce belief(set).modified(fact) instead of set(null) and set(fact)
*- have some sniffer for standalone
*- have the logger for standalone
*- allow Jadexdoc pure Javadoc generation (show .java files in tree etc.)
*- make trigger more generic so that plan, waitqueue, goal, metagoal have a common base
*- improve test center allowing agents to be tested and executed (normal application agents 
		should be testable)
*- introduce semantic model checks where applicable, e.g. if two message types are equal wrt. their type
		ie. all fixed values are the same 
- Javacc: implement inline plan bodies
- plugin mechanism for XML-schema and meta-actions (triggered by system events?!)
	- EasyDeliberation plugin
	- planning plugin
- clean goal deliberation semantics (see g1)

*- mobility support (standalone)
*- abstract concrete migration capabilities
- model/adf checking
*	- check if for a parameter an assignto is missing?!
*- meta-info about plans (accessed beliefs etc.)
- (optionally) keep plans when suspending goals
- reloading for included jar files
- check implementing capability against abstract capability
- tutorial about using goals (the right way)
- (goal-message mapping)
- (inheritance for elements)
- parameter mapping from/to beliefs (currently is possible for goals/events)
- native/event message mapping (see also ADK?)
- clean message semantics (pluggable de/encoder for certain parameters of certain types of messages such as content, sender, etc. in fipa)
*- clean up belief sets (introduce un/ordered)
- add belief maps?
- conceive clean message semantics native->jadex, what to do when (one) receiver is unknown?!
- icons for agents (specified in xml)
- cross agent reflection (ask/send model representation)?
- useful semantics for message event references???
*- clean goal semantics, especially for performgoal create success bdi flag
*- introduce synchronous sendMessage() (as plan step, option in platform properties?)
*- remove process goals and unify with initial events to a plan "cause" (also support fact-added cause!?)
*- agent persistence (with javaflow plans)
*- automatic agent persistence (when no or long wait, and low message volume)
*- timing conditions that efficiently allow to wait for absolute timepoints (e.g. every full hour) instead
    of relative timeouts. also useful for all kinds of timing specifications (belief update, goal retry, etc.)
    for examples see esper docs...
*- Standalone agent without platform? Useful for Agent/Java interface


Features:
	- Platforms:
*		- allow method invocations on agents, e.g. providing an interface through the adf
	- Capabilities
*		- dynamic capabilities
			- removal of elements that still have instances ???
			- create new capability from scratch (use empty capability as template ???)
		- implement inheritance for element references
*		- treat abstract separetly from exported (abstract elements are always
			visible from outer but not exported)
?		- shared (peer) capabilities for more than one agent
	- Goals
			- activation trigger for goal (i.e. when should they execute plans)
				- maintain goal with 3 conditions: start/end activities, maintain cond only for state determination
				- maybe similar to threats?! 
(g1)*	- what do we want to support for goals: how is the interplay?
			- cardinality for adopted goals
			- uniqueness
			- cardinality for active goals
*		- remove query goal failure/target condition, problem with jbind
			- could be realized as pure runtime condition
*		- direct mapping of messagevents resp. messages to goals
		- degree of goal achievement (softgoal?, fuzzygoal?)
		- goal unification (if two goals are equal, only one has to be pursued)
		- lifetime of goals (map to drop condition with timing)
?		- goal adoption: should consider current Goals/Beliefs
		- assign goal results to beliefs (automatically update belief, when goal is finished).
		- is there a clean way to get rid of randomwalk/leastseenwalk/exploremap plans?
			- handle goals (lookforwaste/querywastebin/querychargingstation)
				by creating other goals (parameterized movetos).
		- introduce belief bindings for goals (result and parameter binding per belief names?)
*		- allow triggering event for metagoals to be accessed in ADF (via $event)
		- new goal type "preserve" (perform plans until first failure)
?		- introduce "ignoreinitial={true, false}" for beliefchange trigger
*		- allow goalmapping for metagoals (see puzzle example in webbridge)
	- Beliefs
*		- clean up sets - ordered or unordered or both, maybe a new IOrderedBeliefSet interface?
		- belief pre-requisites?
		- read-only beliefs (e.g. for exported beliefs)
			- <belief readonly="true">
			- exception in set/addFact()
			- no exception for automatic belief-update?
		- cyclic belief expression? (update + explicit initial state)
		- basic type access methods for beliefbase? (getIntFact()/getFactInt()? etc.)
		- further belief specifications allowing to declare the content of a
			belief more concretely (the type)
		- intelligent beliefs ?! access causes e.g. a goal to be thrown and result is fact value?
*		- fix class specialisation/generalisation issues of referenced typed elements
*		- store belief freshness (timestamp), add fact expired trigger
	- Plans
*		- meta-info about plans (accessed beliefs etc.)
		- triggers should support parameterset values (what are reasonable semantics
			- contains values, all values are equal, ...)
?		- belief mapping for parameter(set)s
		- bind parameters to plans explicitly. what are the advantages?
		- maximal execution-time customization (per agent? per plan?)
		- multi-threading?
		- fail plan immediately when asynchronous subgoal fails (before calling waitFor)
			- throw goal failure exception at whatever place the plan is (wait or microplanstep)
		- think about possibilities to wait for bundles of events (e.g. wait for
			some specified time and collect all events during this time / wait
			for some amount of events at once)
?		- support non-anomymous inner classes when reloading plans
	- Events
?		- lifecycle for all events: store in base and cleanup when not used any longer.
		- message events: implement alternative matching strategies for parameter sets
			(currently only tests if a native message contains all param set values of the declared mevent)
?		- message events: storing message event instances(?) in event base for access from
			different plans
*		- replace content-class parameter by matching for class of content parameter
*		- systematic way for receiving and sending message conversations (e.g. content, sender/receiver, also for non-fipa message types)
*		- register long-living conversations (e.g. for subscribe protocols)
		- ignore for unimportant messages
		- remove goal info events (if possible)
	- Expressions
*		- (simple) inline plans for javacc parser
		- boolean set expressions: exists/forall
		- set->set expressions: union/intersection(set, set [, set ...])?
		- delete, update (insert?)
			- requires assignments (update), access to original collection (insert, delete)
		- specify parameters in ADF expressions, at runtime crosscheck with required params
		- Query.execute(Object[] params) for filling in any unbound parameters
			without using param name, when parameter order specified in ADF.
		- allow for octal escape codes in strings
		- introduce AFFECTED for runtime elements, e.g. goals (mygoal.myparam)
		- allow conditions/facts/values to reference expressions.
		- allow expressions to reference sub-expressions?
		- updaterate for all expressions?
?		- waitForExpressionChange
?		- Extend expression language for update/insert operations
	- Conditions
*		- allow generic waitFor, e.g. waitFor((goal_type | event_type | ...))
			with more than one element, additionally AND semantics would be nice
			instead of the used OR semantics
*		- use pure runtime conditions for waitFor() constructs to avoid model manipulation
	- Other
*		- Selecting more than one initialstate at once to start an agent (union, etc.)
*		- allow new facts/values for beliefrefs and parameterrefs
*		- remove threads for plan execution (javaflow?)
*		- learning
*		- provide complete check for loaded model
*		- move planlib (DF/AMS) to fipa adapter package?
		- introduce debug assertions for xmls, e.g. plan coverage = 1
		- complete AMS support for DIET (kill agent, shutdown platform, etc.)
		- migration support for janino?
	- BDI mechanism
		- support more BDI flags (retry, recalculate, ...) for events, e.g. message events
		- order of plan declarations is important for apl construction and candidate selection
			-> what order should be used when capabilities are involved (from current scope
				to outside? which side first?, etc?), getAllOccurrences() should reflect that fact
	- Protocols
		- support further protocols such as subscribe
		- integrate timeout in protocols (also on receiver side) -> reply-by
		- support negotiation history on receiver side
 		- task failure reason should be posted to initiator side (request/contract-net)
		- allow receiver side to decide between inform-done/inform-result
		- allow for an agent to participate more than once (e.g. in contract net)?
		- support multiple winners for english/dutch auctions
		- remove domain unrelated objects from protocol communication (e.g. auction description)
		- ea and da should have query nextround info and negotiation history like icnp
		- remove history parameter from cnp_evaluate_proposals goal
		
Internal:
	- Goals
		- separate process goal and proprietary goal (-> processgoal has wrong model element)
		- goal kinds as plugins (Achieve, Maintain, Perform) implemented in
			separate meta-action-sets (Problem: have to use base actions
			for handling BDI flags -> no pluggable bdi-flags?)
			- cleaner separation between (pure) maintain and (currently included)
				achieve goal for target conditions. Should it be possible to
				allow more than one target conditions, for different achieve ways
				for maintenance?
			- state transition in maintain goal (unmaintainable to unknown)
		- copyContentFrom semantics? independence between process goal and proprietary goal
			- e.g. dynamic parameter expressions should not be copied (wrong scope)?
		- abort for all goals (not just post-to-all, defaults to true)?
		- GOAL_ADDED/REMOVED events should be distinguishable for prop vs. process goals
		- move parameter check to parameter element
*		- check values of required out parameters on return
		- do not make original goal accessible from goal event???
		- perform goal should not generate warning event not handled?
		- remove goal events (no longer needed with clean waitFor!?)
	- Beliefs
		- check types of references when setting values (also for parameters and sets).
	- Messages
		- match replies also to event references (what is the current behaviour?)
		- nugget-encoder should print out a warning in case the encoding of (parts of)
		  a message fails due to improperly named get/set-Methods
	- Parser
		- merge SReflect.convertWrappedType with CastNode?
		- Fix bug in class-lookup cache. When starting from IDE, static lookup
			tables persist. Sometimes class from old package gets loaded, even
			when not imported!?
		- Fix bug in inner class lookup (e.g. FIPANames.InteractionProtocol)
			when using single class import (e.g. jade.domain.FIPANames)
		- Fix minor bugs/inconveniences in Janino parser
			- read out only used values for expressions $params.get("$args")
			- thow meaningful exception when parameter is not available
			- Caching/precompiling of inline plan bodies at model time
			- allow selects in inline plans?
			- allow keywords written in lower or uppercase!
	- DF Capability
		- find the bug: df failure is not extracted correctly to a content element list (jade post)
		- clean-up keep-registered: avoid selection of wrong plan (meta-level reasoning?)
	- Misc
		- add max keepalive time for conversations (explicitly register conversations?)
		- names of M and RElements are not clean:
			MElements are named with static counter over more than one agent model
		- detect cyclic references in expressions and generate error message
		- fix set vs. list issue (should typedelementsets be really sets?)
		- allow updaterate also for typed-element-sets without initial-values-expression?
		- make all static methods thread safe (e.g. SReflect)
		- speedup ExpressionTokenizer.nextToken() (for change event parsing).
*		- switch to Java 5
		- integrate tracer events in system event hierarchy
		- check all (required/optional) parameter assignments before dispatching a parameter element
		- test three-way references of goals/ievents with parameters
		  (abs<-ref->concrete, concrete->abs->abs, ref->ref->concrete)
		- are there memory leaks for migration (old agent instance isn't cleaned up?)
*	- Memory leaks (confirmed, means that the bug can be easily reproduced)
		- examples/garbagecollector (confirmed)
		- testcases/leaker: internal event vs. goal creation (???)
		- runtimetools/agentmanager (not garbage collected after close, confirmed)
		- BDIViewer observing blackjack dealer (???)

				- kills itself after a timeout (WatchdogPlan)
				- answers ping requests
				- transforms messages to goals and back
		todos:
			- AFC must be running (should be started automatically via the servlet, problem then the servlet must know the platform adapter?!)
				- AFC parametrization from web.xml, which session agent to use in which context
			- there is only one AFC and one type of corresponding session agent
				- maybe allow more than one servlet definition for different AFCs that treat sessions differently etc.
			- Session agent should use some capability to hide the web behaviour
			- how to handle requests withouts sessions?
			- make timeouts more explicit
			- mapping of url to goal name (hiding urls from the session agent)
			- catch failures and print out errors, no AFC found/AFC does not respond
				- provide failure jsps in case of agent failures?!
			- provide security support for sessions

Documentation:
* - Explain setFact() change mechanism of Jadex (only throws a change if object changes)
*	- index for generated documentation (kernel api, schema, planlib, examples)
*	- User Guide
		- necessity of casts for facts
		- mutual exclusive bdi flags (e.g. retry vs. post-to-all, more?)
		- describe parser handling of basic types:
			-> always use wrapped type except for cast nodes
			advantage: static and actual type consistent (except casts to basic types),
				distinction between methods possible: xyz((int)val) vs. xyz((Integer)val).
			drawback: strange casts may be necessary for return values:
				xyz((int)number.intValue()) !?
		- execution model, execution cycle
		- no exhaustive explanation of ADF attributes
		- querying the belief base
		- debugging flag
		- manager agent approach (ASCML)
		- restart platform on modifying classes (except plan classes!)
		- the use of abstract beliefs/ beliefsets in the capabilities
			is not correctly demonstrated in the user guide

Misc:
*	- build process for installer generation.
	- test the AbstractTCPTransport - i've added all addresses including loopback so machines without ip
		can start 2 platforms at once.


Ideas:
	- Regelmäßiges Evaluieren von Conditions:
		- Änderungen an komplexen Belief-Objekten würden bemerkt
		- Generelles Flag für Agenten vs. spezifische Eigenschaft einer Condition?
	- Mapping zwischen (Java)-Plan Attributes und Beliefs/Goalparameters?
		- definiert in ADF
		- beliefnamen nicht mehr in plan hardcodiert!
			(e.g. <attribute name="count" belief="transcnt"/>)
		- Vor ausführen des plan steps setzen
			(AbstractPlan.setAttribute() -> field kann protected sein!)
		- nach ausführen des plan steps zurückschreiben (nur bei änderung?)
		- für einfache Fälle kein getFact/setFact mehr nötig.
		- Was ist mit beliefsets?
		- Was, wenn zwischendurch auf beliefs (conditons, etc.) zugegriffen wird?
		- Wie wird sowas bei anderen gemacht? (3APL?, JAM?, JACK-context?!, AgentSpeakL?)
	- Goal Hierarchy dispatching:
		- AND, OR toplevel goal execution flag
		- Leaves werden an Pläne dispatched
		- Dispatchender Plan wird geweckt, wenn oberstes Goal fertig
