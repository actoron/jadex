# Welcome to the Jadex Active Components Documentation

To quickly get an overview about what Jadex Active Components is about you can have a look at the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started/getting-started.md), which explains the core concepts.
The [Quickstart Tutorial](tutorials/quickstart/01%20Introduction.md) guides you through developing your first application with Jadex Active Components.
The [BDIV3 Tutorial](tutorials/bdiv3/01%20Introduction.md) introduces you to the Beliefs-Desire-Intention Agents and their concepts.

For more detailed information about how Jadex Active Components work, we recommend to check out the ~~[Jadex Active Components User Guide](guides/ac/01%20Introduction.md)~~ in the *Advanced Guides* section.

To see some example programs in action, you can try out some of the online [Java Webstart applications](https://www.activecomponents.org/#/docs/examples) or the [web applications](https://www.activecomponents.org/jadex-applications-web/).

For API Documentation of Jadex Active Components please visit the [Javadocs page](https://download.actoron.com/docs/nightlies/latest/javadoc/).

**Note on Outdated Documentation**: Some of the documentation pages are yet to be updated to the latest Jadex version. The documentation is still valid and the explanations still apply. Yet, due to some API changes, not all code examples in these documents can be used as such. When in doubt, check the example sources in the *applications* modules available on GitHub, e.g. for [Micro](https://github.com/actoron/jadex/tree/master/applications/micro/src/main/java/jadex/micro) and [BDI](https://github.com/actoron/jadex/tree/master/applications/bdiv3/src/main/java/jadex/bdiv3) agents. Documents that are not considered up-to-date in this sense are marked in ~~strike through~~ style on this page.
