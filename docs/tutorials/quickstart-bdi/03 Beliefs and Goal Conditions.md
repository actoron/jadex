# Beliefs and Goal Conditions

This exercise introduces beliefs that let an agent automatically perceive and react to changes.
It also shows how to use goal conditions for controlling goal processing behavior based on belief values and belief changes.

## Exercise B1: Using a Belief to Control a Declarative Goal

Up to now, our cleaner only *acted* in the environment, but did not *perceive* anything.
In this exercise we extend the cleaner to monitor its charge state. The charge state is updated by the environment
as a result of the cleaner moving around. Capturing this in a belief, causes the Jadex framework to monitor the value
and let the cleaner know, if anything important changes. Add the following code to the agent data fields section.
(Remember to make a backup of your last solution as `CleanerBDIAgentA4.java` before making any changes).

```java
	/** Knowledge of the cleaner about itself (e.g. location and charge state). */
	@Belief
	private ICleaner	self	= actsense.getSelf();
```

We want the agent to recharge its battery before it gets too low. We can specify this as a goal.
Using a goal condition, we can directly refer to the charge state value. Add the following code to the goals section:

```java
	/**
	 *  A goal to recharge whenever the battery is low.
	 */
	@Goal(recur=true, recurdelay=3000)
	class MaintainBatteryLoaded
	{
		@GoalMaintainCondition	// The cleaner aims to maintain the following expression, i.e. act to restore the condition, whenever it changes to false.
		boolean isBatteryLoaded()
		{
			return self.getChargestate()>=0.2; // Everything is fine as long as the charge state is above 20%, otherwise the cleaner needs to recharge.
		}
	}
```

Don't forget to instantiate the goal in the agent startup code next to the perform patrol goal like this:

```java
		// Create and dispatch agent goals.
		bdi.dispatchTopLevelGoal(new PerformPatrol());
		bdi.dispatchTopLevelGoal(new MaintainBatteryLoaded());
```

Now all we need is a plan to handle the new goal. Add it at the end of the agent class:

```java
	/**
	 *  Move to charging station and load battery.
	 */
	@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=MaintainBatteryLoaded.class))
	private void loadBattery()
	{
		System.out.println("Starting loadBattery() plan");
		
		// Move to first known charging station -> fails when no charging station known.
		IChargingstation	chargingstation	= actsense.getChargingstations().iterator().next();
		actsense.moveTo(chargingstation.getLocation());
		
		// Load until 100% (never reached, but plan is aborted when goal succeeds).
		actsense.recharge(chargingstation, 1.0);
	}
```

What do you expect to happen when you start the agent? When will the new code be executed and what will happen then?
Try to answer these questions to yourself before starting the program and reading on.

Have your executed the agent and observed its behavior? Watch the console output and try to understand what went *wrong*,
but also what already went *right*. In the following subsections, we will discuss the code somewhat backwards, starting with the plan.

### The `loadBattery()` Plan

This plan is quite straight-forward. The plan handles the new `MaintainBatteryLoaded` goal as stated in the trigger.
Self-check: would you have known how to write the `@Plan` and `@Trigger` annotations?
The implementation is somewhat naive: it assumes a charging station to be known (`actsense.getChargingstations()`)
and just moves to the location of the first charging station, where it starts recharging.

One interesting thing to note is that it tries to load to 100%, although this value will never actually be reached.
So this plan cannot complete. It will *hang* forever at the `recharge()` operation.
For now, keep that in mind. We will come back to that.

So what went wrong in our current cleaner implementation? When you run the program, you will eventually see an error like the following:

```txt
Starting loadBattery() plan
WARNUNG: Plan 'loadBattery' threw exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot move to multiple targets simultaneously. Target exists: Location(x=0.7, y=0.7)
```

Focus on the bright side: our new plan actually got executed! The cleaner moved around for some time and when the charge state
droppen below 20%, the cleaner tried to start the battery loading plan. The only problem was, that it was still performing a
patrol round thus trying to move to two directions at once. This caused the above error. In the next exercise we will fix that.

But first, we want to understand how the cleaner decided, when to start reloading.

### The `@GoalMaintainCondition` and Declarative Goals

Unlike the empty class of the `PerformPatrol` goal, our new `MaintainBatteryLoaded` class had a method `isBatteryLoaded()`
to check, if there is still enough battery. The `@GoalMaintainCondition` tells Jadex to monitor the result of this method.
*Maintain* means that the agent wants to keep the result value at `true` and thus starts executing plans for the goal, when
the value changes to `false`. The expression `self.getChargestate()>=0.2` only evaluates to false when the charge state drops below 20%.
This is why the agent didn't start executing the `loadBattery()` plan right from the beginning, but only after doing some patrol rounds.

Thanks to the maintain condition, the goal becomes *declarative*, which means that the agent can check
(with the boolean expression implemented in the method) if the goal is currently succeeded or not.
This is quite different to the perform patrol goal, which is only *procedural*, meaning that the agent will
always execute plans for the perform patrol goal and always consider it succeeded after successful plan execution.

Declarative goals capture the desired state already in their specification and are thus more decoupled from their plans.
E.g. when the condition is `true`, no plan needs to be executed, whereas a procedural goal will always lead to plan execution.
Also, when the condition is `false` and stays `false` even after plan execution, the agent will look for other plans to pursue the goal,
whereas a procedural goal is always considered to have succeeded after plans (i.e. procedures) are completed.

### The `@Belief` Annotation

So why did we need the `@Belief` annotation? Lets find out: remove just the annotation (i.e. keep the `self` field) and restart the program.
Uh, oh. Not good. Scrolling down the output finally reveals the following source of error:

```txt
Found condition without triggering events (will never trigger): maintain_boolean jadex.quickstart.cleanerworld.single.CleanerBDIAgentB1$MaintainBatteryLoaded.isBatteryLoaded()
```

What does that mean? The Jadex framework does not check every goal condition for every step of every agent all the time
(this would lead to really poor perfomance). Instead it waits for interesting events to happen and only then selectively
checks the affected conditions of the affected goals of the affected agents. Thanks to this, you can run Jadex programs
with a lot of agents that can have a lot of goals with a lot of conditions without the need for a supercomputer.

The drawback is, that Jadex needs to know for which events to look. Thankfully, Jadex analyzes your code and is able
to deduce many events automatically as long as your condition code refers to fields marked as `@Belief`.
Therefore having the annotation at the `self` field allows Jadex to see that the maintain condition, that also refers
to this field, should be re-checked whenever the `self` belief value changes.

So thats all there is to know, right? Well, almost. Actually the value of the `self` field does not change.
The field holds a reference to an object of type `ICleaner`. The reference (`self` field) itself does not change,
but an attribute of the referenced cleaner object. This change is published as a *bean property change*.
If you are interested in more details, e.g. for augmenting your own belief objects with property change support
you can have a look at a simple example from the official
[Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/beans/PropertyChangeSupport.html).

## Exercise B2: Using Deliberation Settings for Managing Conflicting Goals

Lets tackle the remaining problem. Currently the cleaner tries to load its battery but doesn't stop
the active patrol round. As the cleaner cannot move in two directions at once, there is a conflict
between the previous perform patrol goal and the new maintain battery loaded goal.

We somehow want to tell the cleaner to prioritize the latter and stop executing plans for the former
until the battery is loaded again. This is actually quite simple with Jadex. Change the `@Goal`
annotation of the `MaintainBatteryLoaded` class to the following code:

```java
	@Goal(recur=true, recurdelay=3000,
		deliberation=@Deliberation(inhibits=PerformPatrol.class))	// Pause patrol goal while loading battery
```

### The `@Deliberation` Annotation and the `inhibits` Setting

The code above introduces deliberation settings that can be added to `@Goal` annotations.
Deliberation means that the agent keeps track of its current goals and decides (i.e. *deliberates*)
if some of them need to be suspended in favor of other more important goals.
When the more important goals are completed, the agent can resume the previously suspended less
important goals.

In Jadex, deliberation criteria can be specified by so called *inhibition arcs*, which can be seen
as pointers from the more important goals to the less important goals. As long as such a more important
goal is actively processed (i.e. plans are executed for the goal), all other goals connected by
the inhibition arcs are *inhibited*, i.e. prevented from executing plans.

In our cleaner example, the maintain battery loaded goal now inhibits the perform patrol goal.
As a result, any active patrol plan will be aborted as soon as the maintain battery loaded goal
becomes active. Thus now the load battery plan should succeed, because the patrol plan cannot interfere
anymore:

*Figure B.1: Inhibition arcs explained*

Execute the program and test the behavior. What do you observe?

## Exercise B3: Separate Maintain and Target Conditions

Another improvement but still not quite there. Now the charging plan works in the sense that
the cleaner moves to a charging station and starts charging. As soon as it reaches 20% the goal
condition is satisfied again. The maintain battery loaded goal is a declarative goal due to its
maintain condition. Therefore the agent notices the condition to be true again and thus stops
executing the `loadBattery()` method. Anyways, executing a plan when the goal is already achieved
would be a waste of time, right?

Well, in general: yes. But in this case we want the cleaner to load the battery some more before
resuming the patrol round. We can specify this by adding an explicit *target* condition as another
method of the `MaintainBatteryLoaded` class:

```java
		@GoalTargetCondition	// Only stop charging, when this condition is true
		boolean isBatteryFullyLoaded()
		{
			return self.getChargestate()>=0.9; // Charge until 90%
		}
```

So now we have `isBatteryLoaded()` to state when the agent should *start* charging (*maintain condition*)
and `isBatteryFullyLoaded()` to state when the agent should *stop* charging (*target condition*).
Here we stop at 90%. Remember that the plan tried to load until 100%. So still the plan never completes
but now it isn't stopped at 20% but only at 90%.

Execute the program to observe that the agent now exhibits a somewhat useful periodic sequence of
patrol/recharge behaviors.
