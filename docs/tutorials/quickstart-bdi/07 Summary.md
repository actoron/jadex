## Solutions and Answers to Questions

Here you can find solutions for code you had to write yourself and the answers to questions from different exercises.

### Exercise Zero: A Simple Java Cleaner Agent

A possible way of structuring the cleaner behavior is shown in the following flow chart:

![Decision tree for simple cleaner behavior](behavior-simplecleaner.svg "Decision tree for simple cleaner behavior")

Here is a solution with a single loop and nested if-then-else statements for the different tasks and phases of the robot.
Note that the solution has some problems, e.g., not immediately stopping a move action when finding a needed waste bin
and a severe bug that the agent will try to pick up waste that no longer exists, when it was removed in the mean time.
 
```java
		// Agent uses one main loop for its behavior
		while(true)
		{
			// Need to recharge (less than 20% battery)?
			if(actsense.getSelf().getChargestate()<0.2)
			{
				// Charging station known?
				if(!actsense.getChargingstations().isEmpty())
				{
					// Move to charging station and recharge
					IChargingstation	station	= actsense.getChargingstations().iterator().next();
					actsense.moveTo(station.getLocation());
					actsense.recharge(station, 0.9);
				}
				else
				{
					// Move around to find charging station
					actsense.moveTo(Math.random(), Math.random());					
				}
			}
			
			// Waste picked up?
			else if(actsense.getSelf().getCarriedWaste()!=null)
			{
				// Waste bin known?
				if(!actsense.getWastebins().isEmpty())
				{
					// Move to waste bin and drop waste
					IWastebin	bin	= actsense.getWastebins().iterator().next();
					actsense.moveTo(bin.getLocation());
					actsense.dropWasteInWastebin(actsense.getSelf().getCarriedWaste(), bin);
				}
				else
				{
					// Move around to find waste bin
					actsense.moveTo(Math.random(), Math.random());					
				}
			}
			
			// Not carrying waste
			else
			{
				// Waste known?
				if(!actsense.getWastes().isEmpty())
				{
					// Move to waste and pick it up
					IWaste	waste	= actsense.getWastes().iterator().next();
					actsense.moveTo(waste.getLocation());
					actsense.pickUpWaste(waste);
				}
				else
				{
					// Move around to find waste
					actsense.moveTo(Math.random(), Math.random());					
				}
			}
		}
```

### Exercise A3: Additional Patrol Plan Code

![Route for Patrol Plan 2](patrol-plan2.svg)

```java
	/**
	 *  Declare a second plan for the PerformPatrol goal.
	 */
	@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=PerformPatrol.class))
	private void	performPatrolPlan2()
	{
		// Follow another path around the middle of the museum.
		System.out.println("Starting performPatrolPlan2()");
		
		// Fill in moveTo() commands, e.g. according to the figure
		actsense.moveTo(0.3, 0.3);
		actsense.moveTo(0.3, 0.7);
		actsense.moveTo(0.7, 0.7);
		actsense.moveTo(0.7, 0.3);
		actsense.moveTo(0.3, 0.3);
	}
```

![Route for Patrol Plan 3](patrol-plan3.svg)

```java	
	/**
	 *  Declare a third plan for the PerformPatrol goal.
	 */
	// Fill in @Plan annotation and method body for third patrol plan,
	// e.g. according to the figure
	@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=PerformPatrol.class))
	private void	performPatrolPlan3()
	{
		// Follow a zig-zag path in the museum.
		System.out.println("Starting performPatrolPlan3()");
		actsense.moveTo(0.3, 0.3);
		actsense.moveTo(0.7, 0.7);
		actsense.moveTo(0.3, 0.7);
		actsense.moveTo(0.7, 0.3);
		actsense.moveTo(0.3, 0.3);
	}
```


### Exercise A4: Questions about Means-end Reasoning Flags

1. The recur delay only applies after all plans have been executed, the retry delay appears between the plans. 
2. With the or-success flag removed, only one plan is executed. Due to the random selection flag,
    one of the three plans is chosen randomly for each goal processing cycle.
3. The retry delay has no meaning without the or-success, because only one plan is executed and no retry happens.
    You can instead specify a recur delay, to add some waiting time before executing the next randomly selected plan.
4. With or-success set to false, the *AND* semantics is enabled meaning that the agent continues executing plans
    as long as there are plans in the APL. With the exclude mode *when-failed*, all of the patrol plans
    remain in the APL even after they have been executed, and thus can be selected again and again.
    Random selection causes the cleaner to select a random plan from the APL instead of the first. Without
    random selection, only the first plan would be executed over and over. Finally, the retry delay halts the cleaner
    after each execution of a plan.
5. All three plans get executed in parallel and try moving the cleaner to different locations at once.
    One of the plan "wins" and is allowed to execute its `moveTo()` action, while the other two are stopped
    with an error message. Therefore, only one of the patrol rounds is actually performed.

### Exercise C2: A Plan for Finding a Charging Station

#### Alternative 1

Reusing the first patrol plan, you could just add the new goal to the plan trigger:

```java
	/**
	 *  Declare the same plan for the PerformPatrol and QueryChargingStation goals
	 *  by using a method with @Plan and @Trigger annotation.
	 */
	@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals={PerformPatrol.class, QueryChargingStation.class}))
	private void	performPatrolPlan()
	{
		// Follow a simple path around the four corners of the museum and back to the first corner.
		System.out.println("Starting performPatrolPlan()");
		actsense.moveTo(0.1, 0.1);
		actsense.moveTo(0.1, 0.9);
		actsense.moveTo(0.9, 0.9);
		actsense.moveTo(0.9, 0.1);
		actsense.moveTo(0.1, 0.1);
	}
```

#### Alternative 2

A simple alternative is a plan that does just one random move.
To allow this plan being executed repeatedly, you can set `ExcludeMode.Never` on the goal.

```java
	@Goal(excludemode=ExcludeMode.Never)
	class QueryChargingStation
	{
		...
	}
	
	/**
	 *  A plan to move randomly in the environment.
	 */
	@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=QueryChargingStation.class))
	private void	moveAround()
	{
		// Choose a random location and move there.
		System.out.println("Starting moveAround() plan");
		actsense.moveTo(Math.random(), Math.random());
	}
```
