# Using Goals

Goal-oriented programming is one of the key concepts in the agent-oriented paradigm.
It denotes the fact that an agent commits itself to a certain objective and maybe tries all the possibilities to achieve its goal.
A good example for a goal that ultimately has to be achieved is the safe landing of an aircraft.
The agent will try all its plans until this goal has succeeded, otherwise it will not have the opportunity to reach any other goal when the aircraft crashes.

When talking about goals one can consider different kinds of goals.
What we discussed above is called an **achieve goal**, because the agent wants to achieve a certain state of affairs.
Similar to an achieve goal is the **query goal** which aims at information retrieval.
To find the requested information plans are only executed when necessary. E.g. a cleaner agent could use a query goal to find out where the nearest wastebin is.

Another kind is represented through a **maintain goal**, that has to keep the properties (its maintain condition) satisfied all the time. When the condition is not satisfied any longer, plans are invoked to re-establish a normal state.
An example for a maintain goal is to keep the temperature of a nuclear reactor below some specified limit.
When this limit is exceeded, the agent has to act and normalize the state.

The fourth kind of goal is the **perform goal**, which is directly related to some kind of action one wants the agent to perform. An example for a perform goal is an agent that as to patrol at some kind of frontier.

The different kinds of goals need not to be specified explicitly. Instead, it is sufficient to just use the type of conditions that are required to produce the desired behaviour. 

Concretely, a goal can be implemented in the following ways:

- **Inner Class**: If a goal is private to an agent it is often elegant and helpful to use an inner class to represent the goal type. The inner class has natural access to the fields and beliefs of the agent which makes programming less complex. In some cases it is also required to use a static inner class. In this case the aforementioned advantage is not existent, but you could pass the agent as explicit argument in the constructor to gain access to the agent aspects.
- **Class**: A goal can also be represented as a normal Java class. In this case there is no direct connection to the agent available and one has to pass whatever is need via the constructor call or other methods.  

# D1 - Using a Top-Level Goal

The first thing we will try out in this exercise is dispatching a top-level goal.
The difference between a top-level and a subgoal can be understood as its part in the BDI goal-plan hierarchy.
For each goal different plans can be tried out, which in turn may produce subgoals to fulfill parts of their work.
These subgoals again may have other subgoals leading to the already mentioned goal-plan tree.
In this sense a top-level goal is just a goal that has no parent, i.e. which is on the top level of the hierarchy.   

- We create a new *TranslationBDI* agent Java file and add the ```@Agent``` annotation to the class itself.
- Furthermore we need two fields, *bdiFeature* for the BDI API and another one for the *wordtable*.

As you will remember, we need to add the ```@AgentFeature``` annotation to the *bdiFeature* field and we make the wordtable a belief of the agent by adding ```@Belief```:

```java
@AgentFeature
protected IBDIAgentFeature bdiFeature;

@Belief
protected Map<String, String> wordtable;
```

- Create and setup the wordtable in the *init* method of the agent as in previous exercises:

```java
@AgentCreated
public void init()
{
    this.wordtable = new HashMap<String, String>();
    wordtable.put("coffee", "Kaffee");
    wordtable.put("milk", "Milch");
    wordtable.put("cow", "Kuh");
    wordtable.put("cat", "Katze");
    wordtable.put("dog", "Hund");
}
```

- Now, we create a new goal type *Translate* as inner class of the agent. To make the class a goal the ```@Goal``` annotation has to be added to the class definition.
- We add two String fields, one called *eword* and one called *gword* for the English and German word respectively.
  The English word will be passed as parameter to the goal and the german word will be delivered as result.
- We also add a constructor that takes the english word as parameter and saves it in the corresponding field.
- Finally, we add getter and setter methods for both fields:

```java
@Goal
public class Translate
{
  protected String eword;

  protected String gword;

  public Translate(String eword)
  {
    this.eword = eword;
  }

  public String getEWord()
  {
    return eword;
  }

  public String getGWord()
  {
    return gword;
  }

  public void setGWord(String gword)
  {
    this.gword = gword;
  }
}
```

- Besides the goal we also need a plan to handle the goal. For this purpose we add a new method plan called *translate*.
- In the ```@Plan``` annotation the goal has to be specified as trigger.
- Furthermore, we define a parameter named *goal* of type *Translate* for the method:

```java
@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=Translate.class))
protected void translate(Translate goal) { ...
```

This will allow us to fetch the goal the plan is executed for and extract the word it should translate.
The plan body should just fetch the word via ```goal.getEWord()``` and feed it to the wordtable to look up the translation.
Afterwards, the gword should be set as result in the goal via ```goal.setGWord(gword)```:

```java
String eword = goal.getEWord();
String gword = wordtable.get(eword);
goal.setGWord(gword);
```

- Finally, the agent body method has to be created. In this method we actually create an instance of our new goal type and dispatch it as top-level goal. We then wait for the result and print it out.

```java
@AgentBody
public void body()
{
  String eword = "cat";
  Translate goal = (Translate)bdiFeature.dispatchTopLevelGoal(new Translate(eword)).get();
  System.out.println("Translated: "+eword+" "+goal.getGWord());
}
```

** Starting and testing the agent **

After starting the agent it should print out the word for which we have created and dispatched a goal.

# D2 - Using Parameters and Results

The approach used in the last exercise is perfectly feasible, but has a few minor drawbacks. One point is that it is not very comfortable to extract the parameters of a goal manually. The same drawback exists for the goal result in the above solution. Using goal parameters and results this can be overcome in a very simple way.

- As starting point we use the agent file of the last exercise, copy it and modify some minor aspects:
- First, remove the getter and setter methods in the goal.
- Instead, add a ```@GoalParameter``` annotation to the eword field and a ```@GoalResult``` parameter to the gword field.

```java
@Goal
public class Translate
{
  @GoalParameter
  protected String eword;

  @GoalResult
  protected String gword;

  public Translate(String eword)
  {
    this.eword = eword;
  }
}
```

- In the agent body method we can change the invocation of the goal dispatch to directly retrieve the result of the goal. The framework automatically scans the goal for a result annotation and delivers the value of that field (or getter method) to the caller:

```java
@AgentBody
public void body()
{
  String eword = "cat";
  String gword = (String)bdiFeature.dispatchTopLevelGoal(new Translate(eword)).get();
  System.out.println("Translated: "+eword+" "+gword);
}
```

- In the plan we can now also simplify the parameter handling by just declaring a method parameter for our goal parameter. The engine will automatically match goal parameters with plan parameter declarations and deliver them as needed.

```java
@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=Translate.class))
protected String translate(String eword)
{
  return wordtable.get(eword);
}
```

** Starting and testing the agent **

After starting the agent it should behave in the same way as in the last exercise.

# D3 - Goal Retry

A goal is different from a plan because it describes an objective without exactly stating how it should be achieved.
This means that different plans can be tried out to finally reach a given objective.
Besides the specification of plans that can in principle help achieving a goal, the means-end reasoning process can be adjusted in many ways use the various BDI flags.

One of the fundamental flags is the *retry* setting which defines if another plan can be tried out when the first one fails or does not achieve the goal completely. In this exercise we will try out the retry behaviour by using two plans from which the first will fail. 

- Create a *TranslationBDI* file by copying from the last exercise.
- Modify the existing plan to throw a ```PlanFailureException``` after having printed out a text message, e.g. "Plan A".
- Add a second method plan named *translateB* that should have the same method header as the first, i.e. the same plan annotation, same parameter. In the plan print "Plan B" and return the translated word from the map:

```java
@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=Translate.class))
protected String translateA(String eword)
{
  System.out.println("Plan A");
  throw new PlanFailureException();
}

@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=Translate.class))
protected String translateB(String eword)
{
  System.out.println("Plan B");
  return wordtable.get(eword);
}
```

** Starting and testing the agent **

After starting the agent you should see that first plan A and afterwards plan B is executed.
Think about what happens if the second plan would also throw an exception.
Also ask yourself what the agent would do when the plans would be declared in different order or if the second would have a higher priority.
Verify your thoughts by trying these things out in the source code.

# D4 - Goal Creation Condition

Until now we have created goals manually, but often one also wants to create a goal in response to a belief change. In our example, we want the translation agent to create a new translation goal whenever our belief with the English word changes.

- Again we start by copying the code from lecture D2.
- We add a belief for the current English word of type String named eword.

```java
@Belief
protected String eword;
```

- In the goal class we add a creation condition by adding the corresponding annotation ```@GoalCreationCondition``` to the constructor of the goal. As parameter of the annotation we have to state which change provokes the creation of a new goal.
  In this case we just define that everytime our *eword* belief is modified we want to obtain a new goal:

```java
@GoalCreationCondition(beliefs="eword")
public Translate(String eword)
{
  this.eword = eword;
}
```

- In the agent body method we just assign different values to the eword belief.

```java
@AgentBody
public void body()
{
  eword = "cat";
  eword = "milk";
}
```

- Modify the Translate plan to print the translated word, as we cannot print the result in the agent body anymore:

```java
@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=Translate.class))
protected void translate(String eword)
{
    System.out.println("Translated: "+eword+" "+wordtable.get(eword));
}
```

** Starting and testing the agent **

After starting the agent you should see that for each belief assignment a new print out is produced.

In this exercise we have used the constructor as creation condition because we wanted to create a goal on every change of that belief.
But where to place condition code if we want to perform some checks and create a goal only in certain circumstances?
In this case, you can also annotate a method with ```@GoalCreationCondition``` which then can perform the checks and return a new goal instance or null.

# D5 - Goal Recur

The process of means-end reasoning is started when a goal becomes active in the agent. It continues to execute plans until the goal is achieved or no more plans can be executed.
If this is the case and no more plans exist although the goal has **not been fulfilled yet**, the *recur* setting determines how the agent proceeds.
Per default, goals are considered as **short-term objectives** and *recur* is turned off.
The corresponding behaviour is that the goal fails with an exception and reasoning is finished.

If this should not happen and the goal should persist in the agent even if it cannot be achieved immediately, the goal can changed to a **long-term goal** by turning on the *recur* flag.
As result the goal will be paused until the recur condition indicates that means-end reasoning should be executed again. In this case, the set of already tried plans is cleared and means-end reasoning will be performed in the same way as in the first round.

In this exercise we will change the translation agent to keep a translation goal even when a word is not contained in the dictionary. It will then be paused until the corresponding word pair has been added. As recur condition we will use any detected changes to the agent's dictionary.

- Create a new TranslationBDI file as copy of the solution of D2.
- Turn on the goal recur mode by setting ```recur=true``` in the ```@Goal``` annotation:

```java
@Goal(recur=true)
public class Translate
```

- Add a recur condition to the goal that reacts on changes to the dictionary map. To achieve this create a new method named *checkRecur* with boolean return value. Add the ```@GoalRecurCondition``` to the method and set beliefs to wordtable.

```java
@GoalRecurCondition(beliefs="wordtable")
public boolean checkRecur()
{
  return true;
}
```

- Change the plan body to throw a ```PlanFailureException``` when a word is not contained in the dictionary.

```java
@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=Translate.class))
protected String translate(String eword)
{
  String ret = wordtable.get(eword);
  if(ret==null)
    throw new PlanFailureException();
  return ret;
}
```

- In the agent body we create the translation goal and additionally schedule a timed action that will automatically add the word that we will look up.
  For this purpose we need to inject the execution feature as agent field:

```java
@AgentFeature
protected IExecutionFeature execFeature;
```

- Now we can use the method ```scheduleStep()``` to schedule a component step:
  As first parameter is the delay for the step, here we use *3000* to state that we want it to be executed in 3 seconds.
  The second parameter we create a new component step which adds the new word pair to the dictionary using ```wordtable.put("bugger", "Flegel")```.
- After having scheduled the step we create and dispatch a translation goal with "bugger" as translation request.

```java
@AgentBody
public void body()
{
  execFeature.waitForDelay(3000, new IComponentStep<Void>()
  {
    public IFuture<Void> execute(IInternalAccess ia)
    {
      wordtable.put("bugger", "Flegel");
      return IFuture.DONE;
    }
  });

  String eword = "bugger";
  String gword = (String)bdiFeature.dispatchTopLevelGoal(new Translate(eword)).get();
  System.out.println("Translated: "+eword+" "+gword);
}
```

** Starting and testing the agent **

Start the agent and check whether the goal is reactivated by the recur condition triggers.

# D6 - Maintain Goals

As we have illustrated in the introduction of this lecture, different goal types are available in Jadex. To create a goal of a different type, it is sufficient to use the corresponding condition types, i.e. a *maintain condition* in case of a maintain goal.
In this example we will use a **maintain goal** to restrict the number of word pairs in the dictionary.

- We start by creating a *TranslationBDI* Java file by copying it from the last exercise.
- We delete the Translate goal, the Plan and the agent body and instead create a new *MaintainStorageGoal* as inner class.
  In the goal annotation we set the exclude mode to never ```(excludemode=ExcludeMode.Never)```. This allows a plan to be executed again and again without being excluded. 
- Furthermore, we add two methods (without parameters and boolean return value), one called *maintain* and the other one *target*.
  To the first we add the ```@GoalMaintainCondition(beliefs="wordtable")``` and to the second ```@GoalTargetCondition(beliefs="wordtable")``` annotation. This leads to a reevaluation of the conditions whenever the dictionary *wordtable* changes.

We want the maintain condition to trigger when the number of entries in the dictionary exceeds a given number (4):

```java
@Goal(excludemode=ExcludeMode.Never)
public class MaintainStorageGoal
{
  @GoalMaintainCondition(beliefs="wordtable")
  protected boolean maintain()
  {
    return wordtable.size()<=4;
  }

  @GoalTargetCondition(beliefs="wordtable")
  protected boolean target()
  {
    return wordtable.size()<3;
  }
}
```

As consequence a plan for removing entries should be triggered and to remove entries until less than 3 word pairs are contained:

- We add a method plan called *removeEntry* without parameters and return value.
  In the plan annotation, add the maintain storage goal as trigger. In the method, just fetch an arbitrary entry from the dictionary wordtable and remove it and print out which entry has been removed:

```java
@Plan(trigger=@Trigger(goals=MaintainStorageGoal.class))
protected void removeEntry()
{
    String key = wordtable.keySet().iterator().next();
    String val = wordtable.remove(key);
    System.out.println("removed: "+key+" "+val+" "+ wordtable);
}
```

- Then we add an agent body method called body using the ```@AgentBody``` annotation. In the method we first create and dispatch a maintain storage goal as top-level goal of the agent.
- Next, we create the wordtable and add four different word pairs.
  To activate the maintain goal we add a new word pair every two seconds.
  This can be achieved by using the ```repeatStep``` method of the execution feature:
    - As first parameters we use *0,2000* to execute without delay and repeat every two seconds.
    - As third parameter, we create a component step that declares an integer field *cnt* (as counter).
      In the execute method of the step we add a new word pair using the *cnt* which is incremented to make it unique each time.
      Afterwards, we print the contents of the dictionary:

```java
@AgentBody
public void body()
{
  bdiFeature.dispatchTopLevelGoal(new MaintainStorageGoal());

  wordtable = new HashMap<String, String>();
  wordtable.put("milk", "Milch");
  wordtable.put("cow", "Kuh");
  wordtable.put("cat", "Katze");
  wordtable.put("dog", "Hund");


  execFeature.repeatStep(0, 2000, new IComponentStep<Void>()
    {
      int cnt = 0;
      public IFuture<Void> execute(IInternalAccess ia)
      {
        wordtable.put("eword_#"+cnt, "gword_#"+cnt);
        cnt++;
        System.out.println("wordtable: "+wordtable);
        return IFuture.DONE;
      }
    });
}
```

** Starting and testing the agent **

Start the agent and observe the print outs on the console. You should see entries getting added periodically.
When five entries are in the dictionary, the maintain goal is activated and entries get removed until only two remain.
This process then repeats.
